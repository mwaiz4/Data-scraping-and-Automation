I made this repository to track my progress learning data scraping and automation. I am using the Zameen.com website as a test scraping website. BeautifulSoupZameenScraping.py is the
basic data scraping script that can be written. ZameendatascrapingV2 is one step up and does a little more but still pretty basic, It uses beautifulsoup to scrape Zameen.com, looks for 
cards in selected category and fetches price, location, bedrooms, bathrooms etc for each card, pushes the data onto a text file in an organized manner.
Limitations:Only scrapes one page at a time, uses text format to store data, Adds some extra listings with only price
I will make improvements whenever I get time, for now I'm learning selenium and focusing on uni
